Mid life crisis? Ha! That’s what many close to me thought I was going through when I mentioned my decision to go fully into tech and pursue software development. The looks of confusion I got were actually scary to me. Not in the sense of being scared for myself but for them. Crossovers in careers is very common in today’s modern society. If what you currently do no longer challenges you or motivates you to continue to excel then I must inform you that if you decide to settle and stay put where you are, you my friend will become miserable.

Speaking for myself, I could no longer see myself doing the same thing for the next 10 years. Impossible! I was bored out of my mind and with that came misery. I didn’t care if the pay was good. Money is not my source of happiness. Waking up to a passion, eager to learn more and actually love what I do is what I strive for in life. Now, don’t get me wrong, money is needed for survival, to save for a future and be able to do the things we enjoy doing to continue to live our life as we please but money will never determine my happiness.

The moment I knew I was no longer happy in my choice of career and the potential path for it down the line, that’s when I knew I was in big trouble. I remember clearly one day, going on my daily walks outside to enjoy some amazing fresh air, how as music blasted through my headphones, my mind was far from what was playing and more like conversating. Yes, I was having a conversation with myself in my head. Do you really want to be a project analyst and manager for the rest of your life? Do you really want to implement system softwares and cover yourself in stress on something you don’t love? That instance, those questions, that mini conversation with myself was enough to take the blind fold off and say enough. I will not settle for the above. I don’t even love what I do. Yes, I said it. My career of choice was no longer a love but an obligated job because in the end I have finances to care of.

As I walked back home, I knew I needed to get back on my computer and research what I for years had turned my back to because I, at the time didn’t feel good enough for. I researched on google how to start coding applications and programs. Let me tell you from there on, its been a journey. Now I did forget to mention a piece of information above. Before spending 10 years in the healthcare industry, I did minor in Digital arts and Design. I was a proficient and good graphic designer and did learn html, css and javascript. Once I graduated with my minor, I attempted to do some freelance work which was great in the beginning. The lack of a non consistent salary was definitely not the route for me. I needed job security and its when I decided to Major in Healthcare Administration and have spent the last 10 years working in the field.

Today, after years of neglecting my passion, I decided to finally take the steps to do what I know will be best for me and my future. Before joining the Software Engineering program at Flatiron, I did a refresh course online of HTML, CSS and some Javascript just to see if this was really the route I wanted to go for. Not a doubt in my mind, I knew this is what I want. I went for it. Currently learning Ruby and all though it has its challenges, I have been able to grasp the information thus far. Honestly can’t wait to see what the next 9 months will be while attending flatiron and enchancing and sharpening my skills everyday to become a great software engineer in the near future and hoping to get to work for one of my favorite companies. I am already a loyal customer, why not work with them in creating bigger and better for the future in tech!?

I’ll probably share that company’s name down the line. For now, looking forward to long nights, a minimal social life and lots of concentration and work. I can do this!

Oh yea, and so can you! Don’t doubt your dreams or passions. Go for them at full force! If you fail, get back up and try again!
